##Todo Project
##Abstract:

A todo list application is a simple yet powerful tool that helps users keep track of their tasks, appointments, and deadlines. The application allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, assign priorities and due dates, and view completed tasks. The MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack is an ideal choice for developing a todo list application because it provides a full-stack solution that includes a powerful database, a flexible back-end framework, and a modern front-end library.
##Software Requirements:

To build a todo list application using the MERN stack, you will need the following software:

MongoDB: a NoSQL database that stores task data.

Express: a flexible web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.

React: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces that allows developers to create reusable UI components.

Node.js: a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side.

NPM (Node Package Manager): a package manager that allows developers to install and manage dependencies for their Node.js projects.

Git: a version control system that allows developers to track changes to their code and collaborate with others.

Code editor: a tool for writing and editing code. Some popular options include Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text.

With these tools, you can create a robust and scalable todo list application using the MERN stack.
